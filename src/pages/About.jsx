      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
I am a self-taught web developer since August of 2023. The road has been long but rewarding. I have been a medical LMT in the US healthcare system since 2016. While my passion is healing, I have learned that A) I will never be able to financially thrive doing solely healing work, and B) I need a retirement plan that is not reliant on my body. <br /><br />

In 2009 I completed a BA in Foreign Languages (Japanese & Spanish). I have always had a passion for languages. Computer languages have always seemed closely related to foreign languages. Plus, technology has always been an interest of mine. The one computer science class I took in college was led by an impatient teacher. This dampened my spirits and motivation to learning anything in the field of technology for a while. Until I finally made the commitment in 2023 to learn on my own. One of the things I love about technology, is that it is entirely possible to learn on your own. Especially with AI by your side. Huge shout out to FreeCodeCamp.org for being my first and favorite platform for learning the foundations of web development. <br /><br />

Since starting my web development journey in 2023, a lot has changed - both personally and in the broader field of technology. AI has grown smarter, and in May 2025 I moved from Seattle to Dallas to start a new chapter in my life. <br /><br />

My goal is to be a remote contract web developer. Working with companies that prioritize hiring local, and thus supporting their community, and ultimately their country. <br /><br />

I have done contract work for Amazon and other corporations who outsource a large part of their labor overseas. I have seen firsthand the damage done to both local communities and the globe as a whole, as a result of outsourcing. Just because something is legal, doesn’t meant make it ethical. And so I choose to only work with companies who understand this, and thus prioritize their community. <br /><br />

Some of my other passions and interests include:<br />

<ul>
  <li>fitness (calisthenics/gymnastics)</li>
  <li>health and nutrition</li>
  <li>homesteading/gardening (currently adjusting to apartment life, until I get a bigger house/property)</li>
  <li>manifesting/metaphysics/spirituality/astrology</li>
  <li>productivity</li>
  <li>financial freedom</li>
  <li>video games (PS5 owner)</li>
  <li>travel</li>
  <li>being biracial</li>
  <li>local community enrichment</li>
  <li>Dogs (German Shepherd’s)</li>
</ul>

I will be using this site not only as my portfolio, but as a blog to showcase my journey. I am not very materialistic, but I do need to buy things from time to time like everyone else. So when I do find products that I love, I will post them here, along with affiliate links. <br /><br />

My hope is that others will take inspiration and motivation from my journey.
